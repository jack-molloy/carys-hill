            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                My PhD considers the emergence of subscription-based feminist communities through a digital ethnography of three UK-based feminist subscription services which offer private digital community spaces, among other services.  Building on scholarship which explores the relationship between contemporary feminism and the digital economy and the ways in which the digital economy is shaping feminist activism, knowledge production and community-building, I ask:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How do members and creators negotiate and navigate tensions between community and commodity in subscription-based feminist communities?</li>
                <li>What kinds of feminist subjectivities and feminist politics emerge in subscription-based feminist communities?</li>
                <li>What can subscription-based feminist communities tell us about
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            the relationship between feminism, commercialisation and monetisation, and the digital economy,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            community-building in a time of economic crisis, including the cost of living crisis, the retreat of government funding for arts, media and culture initiatives, and the concurrent increase in self-funded, crowd-sourced organisations, and 
                        </li> 
                        <li>
                            the emergence and popularity of the subscription economy more broadly.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>To explore these questions I employ a variety of methods, including discourse analysis of social media content, mailing lists and websites, interviews with community members and organisers, and zine-making-based focus groups with community members.</p>
