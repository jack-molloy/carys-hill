                I am a third year PhD student in the Department of Sociology. My PhD explores negotiations of community
                and commodity in feminist subscription services &ndash; in particular, feminist organisations who provide community spaces in exchange for a monthly subscription fee. I have previously researched body positivity on Instagram, and experiences of online communities with the <a href="https://antidietriotclub.co.uk/" >Anti Diet Riot Club</a>.
